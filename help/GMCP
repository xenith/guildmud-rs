The intention of GMCP (and its predecessors such as ATCP) is to allow
"out of band" information to be sent from the MUD server to the client, or
the client to the server. In this context "out of band" means "invisible
to the player". The messages are enclosed with Telnet escape sequences,
and as such clients (that support these sequences) accept these messages
but do not display them directly on the screen.

Thus, a server can send details like room numbers, available exits, player
health and mana, changes to inventory and quests, and other details. This
greatly simplifies client design, because instead of clients having to
match and parse very specific textual elements (like "prompt" lines)
which can be subject to change, or suppression, the client can instead
interpret the GMCP data which should not change, even if the player
alters their configuration.

It also allows clients to easily display some things (like chat messages,
combat information) in separate windows, or panes of an existing window,
without there being any ambiguity about what a particular message means.
